## `count.rs`
Tallies the  performance of part one and two for each day and displays information about the overall performance.
A file `compile.sh` that compiles a program given a day, (e.g `./compile.sh day_01`) must be present in the year folder.
Compile and run the count program:

```bash
rustc count.rs
./count 2018
```
